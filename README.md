# 🇱🇰 Travel in Sri Lanka - Web-Based Tour Booking System

## 📝 Project Overview

**Travel in Sri Lanka** is a dynamic and user-friendly web-based **tour booking system** developed using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**.

Designed for both educational and small business use, the system demonstrates how front-end design and back-end logic can be integrated into a cohesive travel booking solution.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🏖️ Display of top travel destinations in Sri Lanka
- 🧳 Tour package listings with descriptions, pricing, and duration
- 📝 Tour booking form with PHP backend processing
- 📩 Contact form with server-side validation
- 📅 Option to select travel dates
- 📱 Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop
- 🔒 Simple form validation and security practices

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structuring content
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Client-side interactivity
- **PHP 7+** – Backend form handling and basic logic
- *(Optional: Bootstrap 4/5 for UI components and responsiveness)*

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 📌 Requirements

- A local web server with PHP support (e.g., [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), WAMP, or MAMP)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### 🧰 Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone or download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-sri-lanka-booking.git
````

2. **Move the folder** to your local server directory:

   * XAMPP: `C:\xampp\htdocs\travel-sri-lanka-booking`
   * WAMP: `C:\wamp64\www\travel-sri-lanka-booking`

3. **Start Apache** from the XAMPP/WAMP control panel.

4. **Open your browser** and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost/travel-sri-lanka-booking/
   ```

## 🔧 How It Works

* Users visit the homepage to browse top destinations.
* They can navigate to the **Tours** page to view available tour packages.
* On the **Booking** page, users fill out a form to reserve a tour. The data is sent to `booking.php`, which simulates backend processing.
* The **Contact** form allows users to send travel inquiries via `contact.php`.
